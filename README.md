# Multes

Multes [1] is the multi-tenant incarnation of Caribou [2]. It implements **smart distributed storage** built with FPGAs that can efficiently be shared by a large number of tenants. Each node stores key-value pairs in main memory and exposes a simple interface over TCP/IP [3] that software clients can connect to. 

It is **smart** because it is possible to offload filtering into the storage nodes. The nodes can also perform scans on the data. In this design filtering is a combination of regular expression matching and predicate evaluation. Different types of processing can, however, easily be added to the processing pipeline. 

It is **distributed** because it runs on multiple FPGAs that replicate the data using a leader-based consensus protocol [4] that is both low latency and high throughput.

It is **storage** because it stores key-value pairs in a Cuckoo hash table and implements slab-based memory allocation. The current design uses DRAM to store data, as an exploration for solutions that will work well with the emerging non-volatile memory technologies.
